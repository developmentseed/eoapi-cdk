/**
 * AWS CDK Construct for STAC Object Loading Infrastructure
 *
 * The StacLoader creates a serverless, event-driven system for loading
 * STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) objects into a PostgreSQL database with
 * the pgstac extension. This construct supports multiple ingestion pathways
 * for flexible STAC object loading.
 *
 * ## Architecture Overview
 *
 * This construct creates the following AWS resources:
 * - **SNS Topic**: Entry point for STAC objects and S3 event notifications
 * - **SQS Queue**: Buffers and batches messages before processing (60-second visibility timeout)
 * - **Dead Letter Queue**: Captures failed loading attempts after 5 retries
 * - **Lambda Function**: Python function that processes batches and inserts objects into pgstac
 *
 * ## Data Flow
 *
 * The loader supports two primary data ingestion patterns:
 *
 * ### Direct STAC Object Publishing
 * 1. STAC objects (JSON) are published directly to the SNS topic in message bodies
 * 2. The SQS queue collects messages and batches them (up to {batchSize} objects or 1 minute window)
 * 3. The Lambda function receives batches, validates objects, and inserts into pgstac
 *
 * ### S3 Event-Driven Loading
 * 1. An S3 bucket is configured to send notifications to the SNS topic when json files are created
 * 2. STAC objects are uploaded to S3 buckets as JSON/GeoJSON files
 * 3. S3 event notifications are sent to the SNS topic when objects are uploaded
 * 4. The Lambda function receives S3 events in the SQS message batch, fetches objects from S3, and loads into pgstac
 *
 * ## Batching Behavior
 *
 * The SQS-to-Lambda integration uses intelligent batching to optimize performance:
 *
 * - **Batch Size**: Lambda waits to receive up to `batchSize` messages (default: 500)
 * - **Batching Window**: If fewer than `batchSize` messages are available, Lambda
 *   triggers after `maxBatchingWindow` minutes (default: 1 minute)
 * - **Trigger Condition**: Lambda executes when EITHER condition is met first
 * - **Concurrency**: Limited to `maxConcurrency` concurrent executions to prevent database overload
 * - **Partial Failures**: Uses `reportBatchItemFailures` to retry only failed objects
 *
 * This approach balances throughput (larger batches = fewer database connections)
 * with latency (time-based triggers prevent indefinite waiting).
 *
 * ## Error Handling and Dead Letter Queue
 *
 * Failed messages are sent to the dead letter queue after 5 processing attempts.
 * **Important**: This construct provides NO automated handling of dead letter queue
 * messages - monitoring, inspection, and reprocessing of failed objects is the
 * responsibility of the implementing application.
 *
 * Consider implementing:
 * - CloudWatch alarms on dead letter queue depth
 * - Manual or automated reprocessing workflows
 * - Logging and alerting for failed objects
 * - Regular cleanup of old dead letter messages (14-day retention)
 *
 * ## Operational Characteristics
 *
 * - **Scalability**: Lambda scales automatically based on queue depth
 * - **Reliability**: Dead letter queue captures failures for debugging
 * - **Efficiency**: Batching optimizes database operations for high throughput
 * - **Security**: Database credentials accessed via AWS Secrets Manager
 * - **Observability**: CloudWatch logs retained for one week
 *
 * ## Prerequisites
 *
 * Before using this construct, ensure:
 * - The pgstac database has collections loaded (objects require existing collection IDs)
 * - Database credentials are stored in AWS Secrets Manager
 * - The pgstac extension is properly installed and configured
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // Create database first
 * const database = new PgStacDatabase(this, 'Database', {
 *   pgstacVersion: '0.9.5'
 * });
 *
 * // Create Object loader
 * const loader = new StacLoader(this, 'StacLoader', {
 *   pgstacDb: database,
 *   batchSize: 1000,          // Process up to 1000 objects per batch
 *   maxBatchingWindowMinutes: 1, // Wait max 1 minute to fill batch
 *   lambdaTimeoutSeconds: 300     // Allow up to 300 seconds for database operations
 * });
 *
 * // The topic ARN can be used by other services to publish objects
 * new CfnOutput(this, 'LoaderTopicArn', {
 *   value: loader.topic.topicArn
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Direct Object Publishing
 *
 * External services can publish STAC objects directly to the topic:
 *
 * ```bash
 * aws sns publish --topic-arn $STAC_LOAD_TOPIC --message  '{
 *   "id": "example-collection",
 *   "type": "Collection",
 *   "title": "Example Collection",
 *   "description": "An example collection",
 *   "license": "proprietary",
 *   "extent": {
 *       "spatial": {"bbox": [[-180, -90, 180, 90]]},
 *       "temporal": {"interval": [[null, null]]}
 *   },
 *   "stac_version": "1.1.0",
 *   "links": []
 * }'
 *
 * aws sns publish --topic-arn $STAC_LOAD_TOPIC --message '{
 *   "type": "Feature",
 *   "stac_version": "1.0.0",
 *   "id": "example-item",
 *   "properties": {"datetime": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z"},
 *   "geometry": {"type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [...]},
 *   "collection": "example-collection"
 * }'
 *
 *
 * ```
 *
 * ## S3 Event Configuration
 *
 * To enable S3 event-driven loading, configure S3 bucket notifications to send
 * events to the SNS topic when STAC objects (.json or .geojson files) are uploaded:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // Configure S3 bucket to send notifications to the loader topic
 * bucket.addEventNotification(
 *   s3.EventType.OBJECT_CREATED,
 *   new s3n.SnsDestination(loader.topic),
 *   { suffix: '.json' }
 * );
 *
 * bucket.addEventNotification(
 *   s3.EventType.OBJECT_CREATED,
 *   new s3n.SnsDestination(loader.topic),
 *   { suffix: '.geojson' }
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * When STAC objects are uploaded to the configured S3 bucket, the loader will:
 * 1. Receive S3 event notifications via SNS
 * 2. Fetch the STAC JSON from S3
 * 3. Validate and load the objects into the pgstac database
 *
 * ## Monitoring and Troubleshooting
 *
 * - Monitor Lambda logs: `/aws/lambda/{FunctionName}`
 * - **Dead Letter Queue**: Check for failed objects - **no automated handling provided**
 * - Use batch objects failure reporting for partial batch processing
 * - CloudWatch metrics available for queue depth and Lambda performance
 *
 * ### Dead Letter Queue Management
 *
 * Applications must implement their own dead letter queue monitoring:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // Example: CloudWatch alarm for dead letter queue depth
 * new cloudwatch.Alarm(this, 'DeadLetterAlarm', {
 *   metric: loader.deadLetterQueue.metricApproximateNumberOfVisibleMessages(),
 *   threshold: 1,
 *   evaluationPeriods: 1
 * });
 *
 * // Example: Lambda to reprocess dead letter messages
 * const reprocessFunction = new lambda.Function(this, 'Reprocess', {
 *   // Implementation to fetch and republish failed messages
 * });
 * ```
 *
