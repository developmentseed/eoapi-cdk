# Deployment CDK code for eoapi-cdk deployment tests

This is a wrapper CDK code that is used to test a deployment of the `eoapi-cdk` constructs before a release happens.

## Requirements

- python
- docker
- node
- AWS credentials environment variables configured to point to an account. 

## Installation

Install python dependencies with 

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the latest `eoapi-cdk` either from PyPI:

```
pip install eoapi-cdk
```

Or alternatively, compile and package from the root of this repository to get the python version of the constructs locally.

Also install node dependencies with 

```
npm install
```

Verify that the `cdk` CLI is available. Since `aws-cdk` is installed as a local dependency, you can use the `npx` node package runner tool, that comes with `npm`.

```
npx cdk --version
```

## Deployment

First, synthesize the app 

```
npx cdk synth --all
```

Then, deploy

```
npx cdk deploy --all --require-approval never
```
